    "description": "Undead Imperial Soldiers are the reanimated remains of soldiers and guardsmen from the previous Imperial dynasty. Their appearance often results from the desecration of Imperial burial sites.\n\nWearing armor, these Imperial Soldiers are more resilient and intelligent compared to their Zombie counterparts. Despite their formidable exterior, they are still decaying corpses beneath the metal."
