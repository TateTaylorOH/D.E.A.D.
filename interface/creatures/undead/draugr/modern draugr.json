      "description": "After the long and brutal Dragon War, the Nordic people rose to establish a flourishing empire. Due to new burial practices, Draugr animated since this period don't have the gray, mummified appearance typical of those associated with the dragon cult; instead, their skin takes on a more pinkish hue.\n\nThese Draugr are not connected to the dragon cult, so their reanimation varies greatly. Some are the honored dead who have fallen victim to necromancy, while others are cursed or bound by various forms of magic, causing them to endlessly roam Nirn."
